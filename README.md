## Big Data Analytics with R and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which performs a data analysis method that automates the construction of analytical models, being able to perform predictive analysis faster than any human would be able to do.

Composed of 3 main types of learning methods:

1. **Supervised Learning**: occurs when an algorithm learns from sample historical data, with inputs (inputs) and possible outputs (outputs), which may consist of quantitative or qualitative values, in order to predict the correct answer when receiving new data.

    * Classification
    * Regression
 
 2. **Unsupervised Learning**: occurs when an algorithm learns from simple examples, without any associated response, leaving it up to the algorithm to determine the data patterns on its own.
     * Clustering
     * Segmentation
     * Dimensionality Reduction
   
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: It's like learning by trial and error. Mistakes help to learn because they have a large penalty associated with them (cost, time wasted, and so on), teaching that a particular course of action is less likely to succeed than others.
   * Recommender Systems
   * Reward Systems
   * Decision Process


## 1. Challenge

This entire section will be dedicated to laboratory studies of Data Analysis, with real and public data, using the R language. In this context I intend to address several business problems in order to solve them improving my technical skills.

It is a practical laboratory with the objective of demonstrating, in a clear and objective way, the application of some of the main machine learning techniques used in Data Science
